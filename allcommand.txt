19. git push origin login(Push code to new branch in github) 
20. git merge login(push login(branch name) to master)
21. git branch -d login(branch name) (To delete branch from storage)

Some Points:
1.	git add -A (Stages All)
	git add . (Stages new and modified), without deleted
	git add -u (stages modified and deleted, Without new)
